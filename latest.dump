4	HẺM GEMS: THE GREEN DELIGHT OF PHU YEN’S BÁNH CANH HẸ	1	<div><h3>HẺM GEMS: THE GREEN DELIGHT OF PHU YEN’S BÁNH CANH HẸ</h3></div><div><p>In the age of the internet, we go back and forth about everything, including&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://time.com/4786181/skipping-breakfast-health-benefits/">whether or not the most important meal of the day is, in fact, important</a>. While members of the medical profession continue to debate the merits of breakfast, however, Saigon is full of early-morning delights, from mouthwatering&nbsp;<em>cơm tấm</em>&nbsp;to bowls of&nbsp;<em>phở</em>&nbsp;and quick-and-easy&nbsp;<em>bánh mì</em>. For a departure from your average morning meal, however, look to a more elusive regional dish: Phu Yen’s&nbsp;<em>bánh canh hẹ</em>.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/UhltNU8.jpg"></p><p>The literal translation would be “chive noodles” and, upon first sight, the soup certainly looks that way: a sea of green specks swimming in a light, clear broth. These colorful clippings are certainly a noticeable feature of the dish, but beneath the surface lay plenty of protein and noodles to make for a substantial morning meal. Chunks of fresh fish, thick slices of fried&nbsp;<em>chả cá</em>&nbsp;and a lone quail egg are joined by a thinner variation of&nbsp;<em>bánh canh</em>, one that’s not as rope-like as the rendition you might find in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://saigoneer.com/saigon-street-food-restaurants/8269-h%E1%BA%BBm-gems-conquering-the-crab-in-d10">the dish’s crab version</a>, but still pleasantly chewy. Toss in standard accouterments like chili and lime, and you’ve got yourself a top-notch breakfast for just VND30,000.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/nn3W47h.jpg"></p><p>The purveyor of this savory morning meal bears the long-winded name Banh Beo Nong – Co Mai Phu Yen. Though the place is open all day – as the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>cô</em>&nbsp;Mai also serves&nbsp;<em>bánh bèo</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>bánh hỏi</em>&nbsp;– you’re better off visiting in the morning, when there are fewer people crowded around the low metal tables and blue and pink plastic chairs.

Now, a local media outfit &ndash; YouTube channel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS96oIR6c7VACKBQFWIXqOw">SUBCULTURES</a>&nbsp;&ndash; has done the same thing, but with local standards regarding males.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short clip is admittedly not as well-researched as its counterpart for females.

In decades past, most local men have tended to go for utility over vanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been some notable shifts in styles though as Vietnam evolved from an agrarian society to one more focused on commerce and trade. This is perhaps most evident in the appearance of Western-influenced apparel from the 1950s on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a look at the typical looks of Vietnamese men through the decades:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J7y4OGqtCqE" width="560"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Video via YouTube channel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS96oIR6c7VACKBQFWIXqOw">SUBCULTURES</a>]</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	2017-11-09 08:08:29.696503	2017-11-18 14:20:34.598302	mXPDnRM.jpg	image/jpeg	253301	2017-11-09 08:08:29.198387	Ever wonder how Vietnam’s standards for male beauty have changed over the years?

In the spirit of potluck, everyone will bring a dish of their choice to share with friends, and with friendly strangers who may become your close friends in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>We welcome all foods – your dish doesn’t have to be a traditional Christmas recipe and nor does it have to be from the countries that celebrate Christmas. Bring whatever you feel like sharing! From salad to biryani, pad thai to kimchi, bo kho to a good old roast turkey (if you can find one!), tasty brownies, fresh fruit, fairy bread or pavlova, to everyone’s festive favourite – a burning Christmas pudding. Potluck is all about sharing what you like to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>If feasible, please comment below what you will be bringing. This way people won’t come with the same dishes (unless you guys want to have a food competition, then go ahead!). Come with your dish pre-prepared, or feel free to prepare it at Saigon Outcast’s kitchen – just let us know in advance so that we can have the space ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Dinner starts at 7pm, sharp! Don’t be late or you might miss out. As we feast, we will be serenaded by the New Orleans folk blues band Wayfarer State, and we will show a Christmas classic movie after dinner from 9pm, with free flow popcorn. Bring the kiddies for some family fun, and he who has the fanciest Santa hat gets an extra piece of cake!</p><p><br></p><p>We will also be running our weekly Saturday Tiger Deal as usual – buy 1 get 1 on all tiger draught including towers :))</p><p><br></p><p>Check out Wayfarer State’s music at these links: <a target="_blank" href="http://wayfarerstate.bandcamp.com/album/the-faustian-bargain">http://wayfarerstate.bandcamp.com/album/the-faustian-bargain</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://consequenceofsound.net/aux-out/no-destination-writing-and-wandering-with-wayfarer-state/">http://consequenceofsound.net/aux-out/no-destination-writing-and-wandering-with-wayfarer-state/</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user1310033/02-trumpeter-ghost">https://soundcloud.com/user1310033/02-trumpeter-ghost</a></p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for another brilliant year, Outcast family.

Throughout the night we will travel from various locations in Saigon on a motorcycle tour while we eat local Vietnamese food and drink our way through our 5 course menu. The “Vietnamese Food Vendors” we will be visiting specialize in very specific Vietnamese Recipes and often only have 1 or 2 Vietnamese food dishes that they offer which is the common theme for local Vietnamese Street Food.</p><div><h2>WHAT KIND OF VIETNAMESE FOOD DO YOU OFFER ON THE SAIGON STREET FOOD TOUR?<i></i></h2></div><div><div><div><p>Our focus for this tasting menu is to introduce our guests to Vietnamese Street Food in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam by offering the chance to eat what we find to be delicious Vietnamese recipes in an order that you would expect to experience at a restaurant.

In the design of the menu, we have thought long and hard about what Vietnamese food we thought was not only great tasting but would also please a majority of our guests while giving them the experience of trying something different, unique, and local to Vietnam.</p><div><h2>WHAT IS THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE DURING THE TOUR?<i></i></h2></div><div><div><div><p>We will be visiting local Vietnamese Street food Vendors on the street or in small local Vietnamese style restaurants so please be prepared to be outdoors in the open air for most of the tour unless the weather in Vietnam decides to not cooperate.

Guests will be paired with an English speaking local Vietnamese guide who will be with them through the whole tour to help explain all of the Vietnamese food on the tour. Also the opportunity for guests to learn more about Vietnamese culture from a real local.</p><div><h2>WHAT DISTRICTS WILL WE VISIT?<i></i></h2></div><div><div><div><p>Our Afternoon Vietnamese food tour will take us through Districts 1,3,5,8, and 10</p><div><h2>HO CHI MINH TOUR ITINERARY<i></i></h2></div><div><div><div><ul><li>12:55 PM -Pick up and Introduction on how to get onto the motorbike</li><li>Riding on the back of a motorbike with a local Vietnamese driver who is trained in customer service and speaks fluent English</li><li>Travel from restaurant to restaurant eating local food during a 4 hour tour</li><li>See different districts of Ho Chi Minh City while traveling on the bike</li><li>Interact with fellow travelers at each location</li><li>Learn about food, culture, and the life of Vietnamese people through fun and interesting conversation with our guides</li><li>5:00 PM- Drop off</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>	2017-11-08 09:23:26.70718	2017-11-08 09:23:26.70718	Traditional-Vietnamese-Street-Food-in-Saigon-Banh-Canh-Ghe.jpg	image/jpeg	115113	2017-11-08 09:23:26.109624
